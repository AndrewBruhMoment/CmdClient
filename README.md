## Note about Pull Requests

Please do not make pull requests while client is still in development.

If you are contributing multiple unrelated features, please create a separate pull request for each feature. Squeezing everything into one giant pull request makes it very difficult for us to add your features, as we have to test, validate and add them one by one.

Thank you for your understanding - and thanks again for taking the time to contribute!!
