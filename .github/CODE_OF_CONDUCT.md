# Code of Conduct

1. **Before making a claim, try to prove yourself wrong.**  
   Test it, if feasible. If not, google it to see if someone else has proven it wrong. This saves you from embarrassment and helps to stop the spread of misinformation at the same time.

2. **Before asking a question, try to answer it for yourself.**  
   Test it, if feasible. If not, google it to see if someone else has asked it before. This saves you time (it is faster to google something than to wait for a human to reply) and saves us frustration (as a moderator, answering the same question over and over again is tiresome).

3. **Don't be a jerk.**  
   We appreciate discussion but do not accept personal attacks and calling people names.
